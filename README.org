#+title: WebAssembly Version Updater

A very early version of what I wish to become the equivalent of jsvu for WebAssembly runtimes.

This is very early work, and it contains all the signs of early work, including commented code, missing features, hardcoded paths.

For now, it's a nice tool do download the latest versions of four WebAssembly runtimes: =wasmer=, =wasmtime=, =wasm3=, =wazero=.

* Usage

Run the binary with the names of the runtimes you want to install:

#+begin_src bash
./wavu wasm3 wasmer wasmtime wazero
#+end_src
